Hi :wave:

I'm Richard.
You've landed on my personal webpage, probably to grab some of my teaching notes.

I'm a pretend academic teaching various bits of the Oxford physics undergrad course at Somerville college.

My *real* job is at [Williams formula 1](https://www.williamsf1.com/), where I spend my time working with aerodynamics data.
Previously, I was a data scientist at [racing bulls formula 1](https://www.visacashapprb.com/int-en), a postdoc at [diamond light source](https://www.diamond.ac.uk/Home.html), and a PhD student/undergrad at [Oxford physics](https://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/).

## Teaching

I want to build an excellent repository of information on this site.
I've taught around half of the courses offered at Oxford physics over the last few years, so I have a lot of material to share, if I can find the time to write it up.

### On sharing solutions

I'm running with the *it's easier to ask forgiveness than permission* approach here.
If you're a lecturer and you're annoyed that I've shared solutions to your course, please contact me.
My intent is never to plagiarize private solutions, although I have consulted *tutor only* solutions to check my own work.
If I have shared something that you would consider to be private, please let me know.

I know that the philosophy of the Oxford physics department is, generally, to keep solutions private.
I appreciate that there is a worry that, instead of properly getting to grips with the material, students will simply copy down solutions.

I absolutely agree that this could be a problem, but the goal of this site is not to provide a crutch for students to lean on.
It's to provide an extremely high quality resource that students can use to learn about each topic.
I'm not simply sharing numerical results here - I'm providing detailed explanations of the methods used to solve each problem.
With every year that passes, I can extend each set of notes to include more detail, more examples, and more explanations.

It's my belief that we can build a genuinely valuable teaching resource using modern web technologies, and that's what I'm trying to do here.
Before you yell at me, please take a look for yourself and evaluate whether you really think that these solutions are having a net-negative impact on the students.

## Research

In the past, my research focused on [magnetic skyrmions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_skyrmion) and on the development of new techniques for the analysis of x-ray diffraction data.
Nowadays, I'm more interested in computational physics in general.

On this site, I intend to write extensive notes on computational physics, as well as documentation for my [`oxphys_numerics`](https://github.com/RBrearton/oxphys_numerics) project.
