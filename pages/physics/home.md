# Physics notes

For each B2 and B6 problem set we do this term, I intend to upload a full set of solutions with accompanying notes.
I'm likely to skip B2 PS1 and B6 PS1, because I was still building this site when we worked through those.

I'm going to aim to have these notes up immediately after the tutorials.

## Computer science + computational physics

I intend to also write some notes on computational physics, and possibly some general software development notes.
While none of these things are on syllabus, I think that they should be.
