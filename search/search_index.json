It's to provide an extremely high quality resource that students can use to learn about each topic. I'm not simply sharing numerical results here - I'm providing detailed explanations of the methods used to solve each problem. With every year that passes, I can extend each set of notes to include more detail, more examples, and more explanations.</p> <p>It's my belief that we can build a genuinely valuable teaching resource using modern web technologies, and that's what I'm trying to do here.
